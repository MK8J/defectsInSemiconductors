==============
There are three types of defects:

  1. A single level defect, being a Shockley Read-Hall defect
  2. A multi level defect being a Sah and Shockley defect.
  3. A single level defect, being that includes auger recombiation.

These are outlined in detail below.
The difference is how many energy level or "charge states" a defect has. A Sah and Shockley defect allows more than two different charge states, which is more than one energy level. It seems that most defects are actually multi level defects.
